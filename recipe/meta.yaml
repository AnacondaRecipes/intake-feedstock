  summary: Data load and catalog system
  description: |
    Intake is a lightweight set of tools for loading and sharing data in data science projects. Intake helps you:
    * Load data from a variety of formats (see the current list of known plugins) into containers you already know, like Pandas dataframes, Python lists, NumPy arrays, and more.
    * Convert boilerplate data loading code into reusable Intake plugins.
    * Describe data sets in catalog files for easy reuse and sharing between projects and with others.
    * Share catalog information (and data sets) over the network with the Intake server.
